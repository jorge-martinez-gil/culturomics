## ðŸ“–  Introduction

Culturomics is a research project that focuses on comparing word occurrence patterns in different periods of human literature to determine semantic similarity without human intervention. This repository contains the source code from the paper titled "Looking for the Best Historical Window for Assessing Semantic Similarity Using Human Literature" by Jorge Martinez-Gil, Mario Pichler, and Alejandra Lorena Paoletti, presented at EDBT/ICDT Workshops in 2016.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

The main goal of Culturomics is to develop computational methods for assessing semantic similarity between words based on their occurrence patterns in historical literature. By analyzing how words co-occur in different time periods, we aim to provide insights into the evolution of language and meaning.
